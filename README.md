      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Unplug the board and then connect the second board to your PC using the provided cable. Follow **Steps 2** and **3** again to program the second board with the **GATT_client** application.

5. Reset the boards. For [CYW955913EVK-01](https://infineon.com/CYW955913EVK-01), you will need to reset the kit for application to boot.

6. Connect the first board (programmed with **GATT_server**) to your PC and open its terminal to view the UART messages.

7. Press the user button on your GATT Client device to start. The client checks for peer devices with the name **TPUT**. If it finds a device with this name, it initiates the connection. Therefore, after pressing the button, the kits will be auto-connected.

8. Press the user button on the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client device. GATT notifications are enabled. The Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server starts sending the GATT notifications of 244 bytes. Throughput is calculated for every second and is displayed on the terminal.
   In this case, the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server calculates the Tx throughput, while the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client calculates the Rx throughput.

9. Press the user button on the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client device. GATT notifications are disabled and GATT write is enabled. The Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client starts sending the GATT write of 244 bytes. Throughput is calculated for every second and is displayed on the terminal.
   In this case, the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server calculates the Rx throughput, while the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client calculates the Tx throughput.

10. Press the user button again. GATT notifications are enabled and GATT write stays enabled. The Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client starts sending the GATT write of 244 bytes and The Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server starts sending the GATT notification of 244 bytes. Throughput is calculated for every second and is displayed on the terminal.
   In this case, the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server calculates the Rx and Tx  throughput, while the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client calculates the Tx and Rx throughput.

11. Consecutive button presses change the mode of data transfer as mentioned in **Steps 7**, **8**, and **9**.

12. If a disconnection occurs, the GATT Server device starts advertising again.

## Design and implementation

### GATT throughput measurement

In this code example, Bluetooth&reg; LE throughput is measured using GATT data sent or received by the application. The application accumulates the number of data packets sent or received and calculates the throughput each second.

GATT throughput = ( number of bytes sent or received in 1 second * 8 bits ) bps

Or

GATT throughput = ( number of bytes sent or received in 1 second * 8 bits )/1000 kbps

While calculating the throughput, consider only GATT data bytes. All the header bytes appended to GATT data must not be considered. The data flow through LE protocol layers and headers being appended in each layer is shown in **Figure 2**.

**Figure 2. GATT data flow**

![](images/gatt-data-flow.png)

To achieve the maximum throughput:

- PHY is set to 2M.
- ATT MTU is set to 247.
- Data length extension (DLE) is used.
- The GATT data is 244 bytes.

#### Factors influencing throughput

Some of the factors that affect data throughput are as follows:

- **PHY**

    The PHY rate used will have a direct impact on the maximum data throughput. You can select either 1-Mbps or 2-Mbps PHY. In this code example, PHY is set to 2M after connection. If the Bluetooth&reg; LE central device does not support 2M PHY, the value falls back to 1M. The PHY selected is printed on the UART terminal.

- **Connection interval**

    Bluetooth&reg; LE connection interval is the time between two data transfer events between the central and the peripheral device (in other words, how often the devices communicate). It ranges from 7.5 ms to 4 s (with increments of 1.25 ms). In a connection interval, there may be only one Tx/Rx pair or, if the protocol data unit (PDU) has the more data (MD) flag set, multiple packets may be sent in the same interval.

    A connection event is the time duration within the connection interval where there is actual Tx/Rx activity happening. The connection event is always less than the connection interval. A connection event ends 1 inter frame space (IFS) before the connection interval. Therefore, the connection interval value chosen will impact the throughput.

    A Bluetooth&reg; LE connection is established with the connection interval value set by the central device. However, the peripheral may request a different value. The central device makes the final decision and chooses a value that may be different from, but closer to, the requested value. 

    The connection interval differs between iOS and Android. It also changes depending on the OS version running on the device. This is because the Bluetooth&reg; LE radio may have to attend to other events from the OS and the number of packets sent per connection event may not reach the maximum possible by the Bluetooth&reg; LE stack.

- **ATT MTU**

    The minimum attribute protocol (ATT) maximum transmission unit (MTU) allowed is 23 bytes. This allows a maximum of 20 bytes of ATT payload (3 bytes are used for the ATT header and 4 bytes for the L2CAP header). There is no limit on the maximum MTU value.

    If the ATT MTU is exactly 247 bytes, 244 bytes of ATT data will fit into a single packet. If the MTU is greater than 247 bytes, the MTU will span multiple packets causing the throughput to go down because of an increase in packet overhead and timing in between packets. Therefore, the GATT data size chosen in the application is 244 bytes.

- **DLE**

    The DLE feature is introduced in v4.2 of the Bluetooth&reg; specification. DLE allows the link layer packet to hold a larger payload of up to 251 bytes as shown in **Figure 3**. This means that for one Tx/Rx pair, 244 bytes of GATT data can be sent or received with DLE enabled. If the GATT data is larger than 244 bytes, it is split, and takes multiple LL packets to be transmitted. This introduces header bytes for every chunk of data and therefore lower throughput. Older versions of Bluetooth&reg; LE can support a maximum payload of 27 bytes.


- **Packet Overhead**

    The LE packet includes many packet header bytes which get added up in each layer that are not accounted for in the application data throughput. To minimize the packet overhead, try to configure the ATT MTU size in such a way that the ATT payload data will always fit in a single LE packet. In this code example, the ATT MTU size used is 247 bytes, which exactly matches the ATT payload data size of 244 bytes as shown in **Figure 3**.

### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     
:------- | :------------    | :------------ 
UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; resources and their configurations as used in this code example. Note that all the configurations explained in this section have already been done in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_<bsp name>\<version>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide). This example uses the default configuration. See [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the 'Bluetooth&reg; Configurator' that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   > **Note:** Unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

**Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server throughput measurement**

In this code example, the kit acts as a Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Peripheral and GATT Server. When the kit is powered up, the Bluetooth&reg; LE stack is initialized along with the Bluetooth&reg; porting layer for the respective device.

In the application, there is a task that calculates the throughput every second based on the number of packets successfully sent or received. A HAL timer is configured for 1 millisecond. A task to send notifications is notified through this timer callback every millisecond. The task sends a notification packet and updates the Tx packet count if it is successfully sent. Use a millisecond timer to send out as many packets as possible to achieve maximum throughput.

A connection is established when any client device sends a connection request. After connection, PHY is set to 2M and a request to update the connection interval is sent to GATT Client. The PHY selected and new connection interval values are displayed on the terminal.

The GATT Server has a custom service called 'throughput measurement'. This service has two characteristics called **Notify** and **WriteMe**. The notify characteristic has a client characteristic configuration descriptor (CCCD).

**Figure 4. Throughput measurement custom service**

![Custom service](images/custom-service.png)

The flowchart for the application is shown in **Figure 5**.

**Figure 5. Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server application flow**

![](images/rtos-server.png)


**Notify characteristic:** This characteristic is used to send GATT notifications and has a length of 244 bytes. The bytes sent are used to calculate the Tx throughput.
- When the GATT Client writes the value '1' into the CCCD, notifications are enabled, and the GATT Server starts sending notification packets that have 244 bytes of data. Notifications are sent every millisecond. A millisecond timer is configured and used for this purpose.
- When the GATT Client writes the value '0' into the CCCD, notifications are disabled, and the GATT Server stops sending notifications.

**WriteMe characteristic:** This characteristic is used to receive GATT writes from the GATT Client device and has a length of 244 bytes. The bytes received are used to calculate the Rx throughput.

**Note:** iOS devices limits the number packets sent in a single connection event to five,thus affecting the througput. By keeping the connection event shorter can help in achieving better throuhgput rate. Prefered connection interval for the iOS devices are 15ms.
